# Algebra Foundations
## What are the origins of Algebra?
The word originates from the Arabic word for 'completion/restoration' from the Mathematician al-Kwarizmi in around 820AD. The word comes from this era, but evidence from stone tablets shows algebra dates all the way back to ancient Babylon on stone tablets. 
The 'father' of algebra is a loose idea, as there are many mathematicians that made significant contributions, including the Greek Diophantus and the Indian Brahmagupta.

# Abstract-ness
## What does 'abstract' mean?
Abstract can be used to describe something like an adjective, an action as a verb, or something itself is an abstract as a noun. 
Abstraction, or abstracting something, mostly refers to the departure of the real world that deals with a focus on ideas and concepts.
For example, we tend to abstract the idea of a cube into a 3-dimensional object that has all sides of perfectly even length. In the real world, this would be nearly impossible to implement.
Abstract art often does not represent a clear image of something perceivable. Jackson Pollock's art intends to capture an emotion, a thought.

Anything that invokes the thought or idea of something can be an abstraction. The number 5 is the symbol used to represent a quantity. The same concept of quantity can be expressed through many other abstractions: roman numerals, tallies, words, and expressions.

# The Beauty of Algebra
The entire purpose of Algebra is the ability to abstract problems into expressions and equations that can apply to different solutions and information. Variables allow for pieces of information to be represented in simplest terms, without having to concern ourselves with the true value or numbers involved. The manipulation of abstracted values leads to equalities in solutions.

# Creativity break: Why is creativity important in algebra?
Algebra is not concerned with the memorization of problem solving, but rather the in-depth understanding of the tools available to deconstruct a problem into an answer. Understanding these tools lead to the ability to solve any variety of problem.

# Introduction to the Coordinate Plane
Rene Descartes was a philosopher famous for his line "I think; therefore I am". He is also one of the most prominent people responsible for the meshing of algebra and geometry, visualizing the relationships between variables and equations. The use of x and y in grids was his direct contribution. since most Algebraic equations are in the format `y = func(x)`, he decided that x was the independent variable, and y was the dependent variable. dependent, meaning that the outcome of y depends on what the input of x is. Coordinates on the Cartesian grid `(x,y)` on the grid form a line where any point on the line is also a solution to an algebraic equation. When x is __, y is __.

# Why all the letters in algebra?
The reason letters are used in algebra is to represent any value. The letter - a variable - is an unknown. The same unknown could be represented by a blank space, a question mark, an emoji, anything.
