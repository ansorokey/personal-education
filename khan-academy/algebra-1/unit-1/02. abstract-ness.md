# What does 'abstract' mean?
Abstract can be used to describe something like an adjective, an action as a verb, or something itself is an abstract as a noun. 
Abstraction, or abstracting something, mostly refers to the departure of the real world that deals with a focus on ideas and concepts.
For example, we tend to abstract the idea of a cube into a 3-dimensional object that has all sides of perfectly even length. In the real world, this would be nearly impossible to implement.
Abstract art often does not represent a clear image of something perceivable. Jackson Pollock's art intends to capture an emotion, a thought.

Anything that invokes the thought or idea of something can be an abstraction. The number 5 is the symbol used to represent a quantity. The same concept of quantity can be expressed through many other abstractions: roman numerals, tallies, words, and expressions.
