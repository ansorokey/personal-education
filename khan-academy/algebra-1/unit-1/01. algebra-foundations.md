# What are the origins of Algebra?
The word originates from the Arabic word for 'completion/restoration' from the Mathematician al-Kwarizmi in around 820AD. The word comes from this era, but evidence from stone tablets shows algebra dates all the way back to ancient Babylon on stone tablets. 
The 'father' of algebra is a loose idea, as there are many mathematicians that made significant contributions, including the Greek Diophantus and the Indian Brahmagupta.
