# What is a variable?
A variable is a stand-in for any input that can change or differ in value. In algebra, a variable is typically written as a single letter in the English alphabet, and even greek letters. When evaluating an expression, a variable is replaced with whatever value we are using.

# Why aren't we using the multiplication sign?
Very simply, the letter x is one of the most used variables. It looks too similar to the multiplication sign. Either use a floating dot, put coefficients directly besides each other, or place a value in front of parentheses.
