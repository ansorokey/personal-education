# What is a variable?
A variable is a stand-in for any input that can change or differ in value. In algebra, a variable is typically written as a single letter in the English alphabet, and even greek letters. When evaluating an expression, a variable is replaced with whatever value we are using.

# Why aren't we using the multiplication sign?
Very simply, the letter x is one of the most used variables. It looks too similar to the multiplication sign. Either use a floating dot, put coefficients directly besides each other, or place a value in front of parentheses.

Problem solving requires looking from many different approaches.

# Evaluating an expression with one variable
*Evaluating an expression* means we have a series of terms and operations, but no value to equate it to. An expression represents a single value in unsolved terms. When evaluation expressions, simply replace variables with the given value and reduce in PEMDAS order.
Remember: when performing PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction) operations of the same hierarchy are solved in left to right order.
10 - (8 + 2) is not the same as (10 - 8) + 2. Order matters.
